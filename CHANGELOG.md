## [v0.30.1] - 2022-08-08
### Added
- user_manager: adds support for filtering users given a list of people ids.
- mongo/user_manager: adds support for filtering users given a list of people ids.

## [v0.30.0] - 2022-07-28
### Changed
- deps: upgrades to `fosite@v0.33.0`.

## [v0.29.0] - 2022-07-28
*Breaking Change:*
    If you are running on Mongo<4.0, please update as the indices will now
    build in the foreground. Mongo>4.0 has changed to a new indexing engine
    and this option is now deprecated.

### Removed
- mongo: deprecates `SetBackground` due to MongoDB 4.0 EOL.

## [v0.28.0] - 2021-10-18
### Added
- mongo: adds support for `mongodb+srv` connection strings.
- mongo: binds in a default TLS Config if `ssl=true` and a TLS config has not been provided.
- storage: adds `Expirer` interface to enable stores to add support for configuring record expiration.
- mongo: implements `storage.Expirer` interface to enable TTL based expiry on tokens.

### Changed
- mongo: migrated internal use of `isDup(err)` to `mongo.IsDuplicateKeyError(err)`.

### Removed
- mongo: removed internal `isDup(err)` function.

## [v0.27.0] - 2021-09-24
This release will add a new hashed index on `signature` for the `accessTokens`
collection. This makes the old `accessTokens.idxSignatureId` index redundant and
can be removed.

### Added
- mongo: migrates to using a hashed index for the signature index on access tokens.
    - The signature for an access token could grow quite large, leading to a
      large index.  By migrating to using a hashed index, the size can be
      reduced to 2% of the original indices size. In our testing we went from
      2.8GB -> 57MB.

### Fixed
- examples/mongo/authorizationserver: removes `mongo-features` example.

## [v0.26.0] - 2021-08-05
### Added
- utils: adds functions to help with adding and removing items from string sets.
- user: adds test cases for enabling and disabling person access.
- user: adds tests for `user.FullName()`.
- user: adds test cases to check create time and update time equality.
- user: adds test cases to check equality of allowed person ids, person id and extra fields in user record.
- user: adds support for storing user roles.
- storage: adds a benchmark for `user.Equal()`.

### Changed
- user: refactors enable and disable functions to use util append/remove functions.
- examples/mongo: updates `go.mod` to `go@v1.14` and tidies `go.sum`.

### Fixed
- mongo: `SetClientAssertionJWT` now logs unknown errors if deleting expired JTIs fails.
- mongo: fixes do not pass a nil Context (staticcheck)
- user: fixes whitespace issues when returning a user's full name.

### Removed
- deps: removed support for dep.

## [v0.25.1] - 2021-07-27
### Changed
- deps: updates to `mongo-driver@v1.5.4`.
    - This mongo driver release contains a fix to prevent clearing server 
      connection pools on operation-scoped timeouts.

## [v0.25.0] - 2021-06-01
### Added
- README: updates documentation.
    - Adds links to download Go.
    - Adds information for working with Go modules.
    - Changes build badge link to travis-ci.com.
    - Changes mgo link to the official MongoDB mongo-driver.

### Changed
- deps: migrates from `pborman/uuid` to `google/uuid`.
- deps: updates dependencies.
    - updates module to go1.14 (go@n-2).
    - updates to `mongo-driver@v1.5.2`.
    - updates to `testify@v1.6.1`.
    - migrates from `pborman/uuid` to `google/uuid@v1.2.0`.
    - removed `mongo-features@v0.4.0`.
- .travis: removes `go@1.13`, adds `go@1.16`.

### Fixed
- mongo: not found on token revocation should return nil.
- .travis: go install goveralls binary.

### Removed
- transactional: removes transactional interface implementation.
    - There isn't an easy way to tell via the mongo driver if the version of 
      mongo running is compatible with transactions (>mongo 4.4) without 
      enabling admin commands to be run for example, `db.adminCommand( { getParameter: 1, featureCompatibilityVersion: 1 } )`.
      Therefore, for now, it's easier to remove it until every current mongo
      version supports transactions.
- deps: removes use of `mongo-features` due to bugfix released via `mongo-driver`.
    - `mongo-driver` wasn't pulling or pushing sessions into the context correctly.
    - `mongo-features` also relied on admin commands/permissions to detect the
      running mongo version to ascertain if the mongo version connected to was
      transaction compatible, so no longer needed.

## [v0.24.0] - 2020-09-02
### Breaking changes
As mentioned under changed:
- `AuthClientFunc` and `AuthUserFunc` now take in a context.
- `store.DB` is now of type `*DB` not `*mongo.Database` but the API remains the
  same. If you explicitly require type `*mongo.Database`, you can obtain this by
  stepping into the `DB` wrapper `store.DB.Database`.

### Added
- deps: adds `mongo-features@v0.4.0` for mongoDB feature detection.
- mongo: adds `DB` a wrapper containing `*mongo.Database` and `*feat.Features`.
- mongo: implements mongo feature detection for correct session and transaction handling.

### Changed
- storage: `AuthClientFunc` and `AuthUserFunc` now accept a context.
    - `type AuthClientFunc func() (Client, bool)` => `type AuthClientFunc func(ctx context.Context) (Client, bool)` 
    - `type AuthUserFunc func() (User, bool)` => `type AuthUserFunc func(ctx context.Context) (User, bool)` 
- mongo: all handlers have moved from `DB *mongo.Database` to our wrapper 
  `DB *DB` in order to provide mongoDB feature detection for managing sessions 
  and transactions, if available.
- examples/mongo/authorizationserver: puts session creation behind a feature flag.

## [v0.23.0] - 2020-08-27
Deprecated - don't use.

The session and transaction implementation does not work for single node users 
(i.e. mongo not running as a replicaset), or those using mongo <v4.0.0.

### Added
- mongo: implements `storage.Transactional`

### Changed
- deps: upgrades to `mongo-driver@v1.3.7`

## [v0.22.2] - 2020-07-06

### Changed
- deps: upgrades to `fosite@v0.32.2`

## [v0.21.0] - 2020-07-02
### Added
- storage: added support for managing and denying JTIs due to newly added 
  methods in `fosite@v0.31.X`'s interface `fosite.ClientManager`.
- mongo: added concrete implementation for `DeniedJTIManager` and 
  `DeniedJTIStorer` to comply to added methods in `fosite.ClientManager`.
- mongo: ensured update time is updated when updates are performed.
- mongo: added config options to adjust mongo connection min/max pool size.

### Changed
- deps: upgrades to `fosite@v0.31.3`
- readme: added version support information for `storage@v0.20.X` 
- readme: added version support information for `storage@v0.21.X`

### Removed
- storage: removed missed entity constants that helped define cache 
  table/schema/collection.
- mongo: removed dead-code index constants resulting from the removal of the 
  cache collection.

## [v0.20.0] - 2020-06-26
### Breaking changes
Removes 'Cache' implementation which actually added a level of indirection, 
doubling required database calls in some instances.

### Changed
- mongo: uses a defined database for testing.
- examples/mongo/authorizationserver: uses a defined database for the demo.

### Fixed
- travisci: fixes travis not running tests over the whole code base.

### Removed
- cache: removed cache structure, interfaces and db 
- `storage.SessionCache` (struct)

to migrate these to use [mongo-go-driver][mongo-go-driver] patterns.

### Added
- examples/mongo: added [fosite-example](./examples/mongo) featuring mongo 
  integration.

### Changed
- deps: updates to `fosite@v0.30.2`.
- deps: migrates from `globalsign/mgo` to `mongodb/mongo-go-driver`.

please report an issue. 

### Changed
- deps: updated `Gopkg.lock` to support dep `v0.5.0`

### Fixed
- mongo: Have added a struct tag to tell the `envconfig` package to ignore 
    processing `Config.TLSConfig`, as the instantiated config it creates breaks 
    TLS mongo connections.

## [v0.13.0-alpha2] - 2018-07-12
### Added

### Fixed
- readme: version link for `v0.13.0-alpha1` 
- default config: Fixed a configuration bug, where repeat connections would 
    lead to the default port being appended multiple times to cfg.hostnames.
- cachemanager: DeleteByValue's query selector should have been querying by
    attribute `signature` not by the non-existant bson attribute `value`.  
- requestmanager: Reverted session data back to []byte due to not being able to 
    unmarshal into an interface. 

## [v0.13.0-alpha1] - 2018-06-18
### Added
- mongo: Added New to re-support custom mongo configuration and hashers.  
- Store: Added top level function override to enable `Store` to conform to 
	the required `fosite` interfaces.
- Store: Added interface tests to `Store` to ensure the functions are available 
	at the top level!

### Changed

## [v0.13.0-alpha] - 2018-06-14
### Added
- mongo: Added indices for quick look up.
- mongo: Added a way to pass the mongo session via `context.Context`
- OpenTracing: Added OpenTracing support. You can now gain distributed tracing 
    information on how your mongo queries are performing.   
- logging: Added logging support. Now provides a way to bind in your own logrus 
    logger to get information, or debug output from the storage driver.
- Client: Added to the domain model. Provides a data storage model for OAuth 2
    clients.
- AuthClientMigrator: Added to the domain model. Provides an interface to help 
    enable migration of hashes for legacy clients.
- AuthUserMigrator: Added to the domain model. Provides an interface to help 
    enable migration of hashes for legacy users.

    storage drivers. See `MongoStore` for an example of how to bind this in.
- AuthorizeCode: Added support for `InvalidateAuthorizeCodeSession(ctx context.Context, code string) (err error)`
    as per `fosite@v0.20.X`
- fosite: v0.20.X support.

### Changed
Pretty much everything.. 

Storage has been re-written in such a way that multiple datastore backends can 
be created, and bound together. This can become useful over time as you need to 
scale out and would like to switch components out to a different backend.

For example, hitting the cache. You could implement and compose in a Redis 
`CacheManager`, which you could bind into your mongo storage implementation.  

- OSS: Updated licenses and added attributions.
- Client: Secret is now stored as a string rather than bytes.
- Configurer: requires passing in `context.Context`

### Removed
- `DeleteAuthorizeCodeSession(ctx context.Context, code string) (err error)` has
    been removed from the interface and is no longer used by the upstream, 
    fosite, library.
- The old API

### Known Issues
- There are no mongo integration tests.
- Documentation needs to be updated to match current API.

## [v0.12.0] - 2018-05-31
### Added
- client: Tests to ensure storage implements fosite interfaces correctly
- request: Tests to ensure storage implements oauth2 interfaces correctly

### Removed
- legal: Removed mergo, now not in use

## [v0.11.0] - 2018-05-10
### Changed
- user: Removed use of lib mergo. Please move to passing through a full update, 
	instead of partials. This caused issues where fields were required to be 
	blanked out, for example, disabling a user account. 
- client: Removed use of lib mergo. Please move to passing through a full update, 
	instead of partials. This caused issues where fields were required to be 
	blanked out, for example, disabling a client.
- changelog: to be changelog compliant!
- glide: unpinned fosite version. Please ensure it works with your version of 
	fosite, please see readme disclaimers.

### Removed

## [v0.10.0] - 2018-04-13
### Changed
- Configuration now allows passing hostnames with included ports, for example: 
    `[]string{"mongo.example.com:123456", "mongo.example.com:234567"}`allowing 
    developers to bypass having to configure `config.Port` as well.
- Configuration now allows passing a custom tls.Config to the Config. This 
    requires manual initialization of a `tls.Config` struct, but enables users 
    to use their own TLS certs for connecting to mongo.
- Cleaned up the Readme

## [v0.9.1] - 2018-03-19
### Fixed
- Fixes AllowedPeopleAccess filtering.

## [v0.9.0] - 2018-03-19
v0.9.0 makes a few under the hood changes in order to conform method and 
attribute naming to make the API cleaner.

### Mongo Driver
First of all, big shout out to @niemeyer for his amazing effort and continued 
support through the years to the mgo Go driver!! It's no small feat, with the 
driver in use today in many production stacks. 

We have decided to move to the community supported fork of mgo as it has a 
couple of extra github issues tidied up and is moving to add support for Mongo 
3.6 features which make some aggregation pipelines easier internally for us. 
As such, this repo is also moving to use the community fork of [mgo][mgo].

Big shoutout to @domodwyer + contributors past and future!
